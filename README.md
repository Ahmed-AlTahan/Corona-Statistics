## ðŸ“Œ Overview

With the global spread of the **COVID-19** pandemic, many websites provided real-time statistics about cases and deaths around the world.  
This project retrieves COVID-19 data from a public source and visualizes it in multiple formats to make the information easier to understand.

The application follows **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and uses the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for clean, maintainable code.
